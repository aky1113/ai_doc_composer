    "You know what I'll never forget about Ashe Stadium at the US Open?",
    "The sheer energy of the crowd there was absolutely electrifying, making every single point feel so incredibly important.",
    "The roar of the crowd when Elina Svitolina won that crucial point was just unbelievable, truly a moment that sent shivers down my spine in US Open.",
    "The way she just pumped her fist after that winning shot, you could feel the whole stadium erupting with her. It was such a powerful display of pure joy and determination.",
    "Seeing Stan Wawrinka on the big screen, a former champion, really brought back memories of his incredible 2016 US Open victory."
