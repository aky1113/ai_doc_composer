    "I remember the time I saw that red train in Switzerland.",
    "The next stop was a charming old town, where a turquoise river curled around cobblestones and a historic bridge arched gracefully, making the whole scene feel like a postcard.",
    "Later that evening, the city lights reflected off the river, turning the sky into a warm amber glow. I felt as if I were strolling through a living painting, with every building softly illuminated like a quiet lullaby.",
    "I paused beside the bridge, letting the hum of bells fill the air, and realized that even in the hush, the city whispered stories of centuries past, Lucerne.",
    "I followed a winding trail toward the valley.",
    "I paused beside the lake, letting the crystal water mirror the Matterhorn, and felt a quiet joy that still lingers in my heart."
